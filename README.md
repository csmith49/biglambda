# biglambda
Source code for the BigLambda data-parallel synthesis project. Based on the PLDI 2016 paper **MapReduce Program Synthesis** by Calvin Smith and [Aws Albarghouthi](pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/).

## Dependencies
The tool depends on the most recent versions of `BeautifulSoup` and `ply`, neither of which are included.
